            <P>

                <UL>
                    <LI>
                        Wash and soak all the legumes together overnight in water.
                        
                        Cook rice as you normally cook and keep it aside. If you do not know to cook rice, check how to cook rice. You can use any rice. I have used white raw rice.</LI>
                        <lI>Wash and chop all the vegetables into medium sized pieces. All the vegetables are chopped and kept ready below. In the picture below, you find peeled potatoes in the center, then brinjal, cluster beans, ash gourd, pumpkin, broad beans, chow chow and curry leaves. All the vegetables together measured 4 cups. You can add a little raw plantain (vazhaikkai) also.</lI>
                <LI>Cook colocasia separately, if adding. Peel the skin and cut into 2 or 3 pieces and keep it aside (adding colocasia is optional).</LI>
                <lI>Soak tamarind in a cup of hot water for 15-20 minutes.  Extract around 1 1/2 cup of tamarind juice by adding more water. Discard the pulp.</lI>
                <LI>Heat 1/2 tsp of oil and saute bengal gram, urad dal, coriander seeds, fenugreek, black pepper and red chillies on medium heat stirring continuously. Once dal turns golden brown, remove from heat.
                </LI>
                <lI>After it cools, powder it finely and keep it ready. This is the sambar podi we are going to use for this kadamba sadam.
                </lI>
                <LI>
                    Pressure cook tur dal with 1/4 tsp turmeric powder for 3 whistles. You can keep the legumes in a small cup along with the dal to save time (picture below). I have the habit of soaking dal for 20 minutes in hot water prior to cooking. In this way, the dal gets cooked to a mush and it also saves a lot of time and fuel.
                    Method</LI>
                <lI>Now in any heavy bottomed vessel, add all the vegetables (except colocasia),  1 1/4 cup of water and cook covered. Do not pressure cook as the vegetables will become mushy.

                    Once the vegetables are 3/4th cooked, switch off the heat.
                    </lI>
                    <LI>In a kadai or pan, heat 1 1/2 tbsp of sesame seed oil, add mustard seeds, when it splutters, add hing, slit green chilli and curry leaves.

                        Then add the vegetables (along with the water if any) and the tamarind extract.
                        </LI>
                    <lI>Add 1/4 tsp turmeric powder, salt needed and the cooked colocasia.  Boil for 5-6 minutes on medium heat.

                        Then add the sambar podi which we prepared and boil again on medium heat for another 5 minutes.</lI>
