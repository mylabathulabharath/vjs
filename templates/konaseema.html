            <h3 class="e">paneer vepudu</h3>
            <p>
       One of my favorite things to order at Indian restaurants is paneer. It is a fresh cheese (i.e., not aged like parmesan) that is common within Indian and Southeast Asian cuisines. Paneer has a chewy texture and generally doesnt have much flavor on its own. To add flavor to the paneer, you can dice the paneer into cubes and add it to flavorful sauces or you can pan fry them.
       <h4>RECIPE</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cut the paneer into thin slices, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Then, cut each slice into 1-inch pieces. Transfer the paneer into a mixing bowl</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of olive oil, turmeric, coriander, cumin, paprika, and salt together. Drizzle this spiced oil over the paneer and toss to coat with the spices. You may need to use your hands to rub the spices into the paneer.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet with 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the paneer pieces and pan fry for about 3 to 4 minutes, until they are golden brown. Flip the pieces over to pan fry the other side. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer the fried paneer to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>Dust the paneer with paprika. Sprinkle with chopped chives and a small pinch of flaky sea salt, if desired. Serve with basmati rice or coconut rice.
        </li>
    </ul>

             <h3 class="g">palakova</h3>
             <p>
                I dont remember I properly have tried making palkova at home. I am not a big fan, its one of the reason I have not tried. Also I always had a thought it is a tedious process.
               <h4>RECIPE</h4>
               <ul>
                <li>In a heavy bottomed, broad vessel, preferably non-stick pan, bring milk to boil.
                </li>
                <li>Let the flame be in medium. Scrape the sides and keep stirring in regular intervals. If you have wooden spoon, you can keep across the pan to prevent overflowing.</li>
                <li>At one stage, milk will reduce in volume and get thickened.</li>
                <li>When it is almost thick like a solid, add sugar.</li>
                <li>Sugar melts and again it will be loosened. Stir for 2 mins. Add ghee and continue stirring</li>
                <li>Add powdered cardamom and keep stirring. At one stage, it will start leaving the sides.</li>
                <li>When it is thick and single mass follows the ladle, switch off the stove.</li>
                <li>As it cools, it gets more thick, so switch off accordingly. In the below picture, the second picture is after cooling down.</li>
               </ul>
