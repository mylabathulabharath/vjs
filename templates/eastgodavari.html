                <h4>RECIPE</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a bowl soak Sabja seeds (sweet basil seeds) in enough water for 20 to 30 minutes. After 20 to 30 minutes strain the water and keep the soaked seeds aside.

                        1 teaspoon of sabja seeds gives about 2 tablespoons of soaked sabja seeds. The addition of sabja seeds is optional. If you want then you can skip adding it.</li>
                        <li>. Take 2 cups of chilled milk in a bowl and add rose syrup. Stir very well so that the rose syrup dissolves in the milk.

                            You can use store brought or home made rose syrup. Instead of 2 cups of milk, you can also use half-half of milk and water. You can also double or triple this recipe.</li>
                        <li> Then add ½ tablespoon sugar or add as required. Sugar is optional and only if you want some more sweetness in rose milk. If the rose syrup is very sweet, then skip adding sugar.</li>
                        <li>Then add rose water. Stir very well till the sugar is dissolved.</li>
                        <li>Lastly add the soaked sabja seeds.</li>
                        <li> Stir again.</li>
                        <li>Pour rose milk in glasses. Serve rose milk garnished with some fresh or dried rose petals or with some almonds slivers. You can also keep the rose milk shake in fridge and then serve it later.</li>

            <h3 class="g">putharekulu</h3>
            <p>
                Putharekulu is a popular South Indian dessert which is known for its paper thin texture. It has a rather interesting way of preparation, as it is made by dipping a handkerchief in the liquidy batter and spread it on an inverted kadhai. The handkerchief is then swiftly removed to leave a stain of batter on the kadhai. The hot kadhai makes it paper thin and crispy. Later ghee and sugar is sprinkled on it and Putharekulu is folded to make rolls. You can also add crushed dry fruits before folding to make it tastier. So, make sure you do try this fascinating South indian recipe at least once.
                <h4>RECIPE</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1 Soak rice
                        Firstly wash rice 2-3 times and soak it in water for at least 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Step 2 Grind to form batter
                        Now preferably use a wet grinder, add soaked rice along with water. Grind till the batter becomes really soft.</li>
                    <li>step 3 Heat the pot
                        Now keep a pot in an inverted position on a stove and let it heat.</li>
                    <li>Step 4 Use a cloth to make Putharekulu
                        Now take the batter, add more water to make the batter of running consistency. Now dip a cloth in it properly. The size of a handkerchief is ideal for the purpose.</li>
                    <li>Step 5 Make rice sheets
                        Now grease the back side of the pot/kadhai with ghee. Spread the dipped handkerchief on the pot and quickly remove it. This will coat the kadhai with a thin shit of batter.</li>
                    <li>step 6 Remove when crisp
                        The sheet will become crispy in a jiffy. Once crispy, remove it. Repeat the procedure to make more Putharekulu.</li>
                    <li>Step 7 Softening the sheets
                        Now take two rice sheets, place them on top of one another and dab a wet handkerchief on them to soften. This will easily help to fold them without breaking.</li>
                    <li>Step 8 Sprinkle sugar
                        Now spread a teaspoon of ghee on the sheets and sprinkle 1 tbsp sugar evenly. Once done, fold all the sides inwards to form a rectangular Putharekulu. Once done, fold from one side to prepare a roll.</li>
                    <li>step 9 Serve
                        Repeat the procedure with the leftover batter and prepare folded rolls of Putharekulu.</li>
                </ul>
